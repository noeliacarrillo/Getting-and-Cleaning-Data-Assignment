# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment

Course: Getting and Cleaning Data
Project assignment:
1. Create a Github repository that contains:
    - code book file to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
    - README file 
    - run_analisys.R script performing the analisys
    - tidy data set file
2. The run_analisys.R script works as follows:
    - Loads all the data sets
    - Selects only the measurements related to mean and standard deviation
    - Merges training and test data into one data set
    - Defines the colnames for merge data and add activity labels  
    - Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    - Orders new data set by subject and activity
    - Save the tidy data set to a file

*Create a Github repository that contains:
    - code book file to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
    - README file

    3. Merges training and test data into one data set
    4. Defines the colnames for merge data and add activity labels  
    5. Creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
    6. Orders new data set by subject and activity
    7. Save the tidy data set to a file "tidy_dataset_assignment.txt"
